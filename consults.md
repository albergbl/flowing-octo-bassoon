## Consultations
I'm an Artist Career Consultant for Springboard for the Arts consulting with individual artists with a focus on artists with disabilities. There are about thirty of us on the [Artist Career Consultant roster](https://springboardforthearts.org/professional-growth/career-consultations/artist-career-consultants/).

I'm available to discuss career and creativity strategies for artists with disabilities, and also have expertise in public relations, literature, and performance topics in addition to grant and fellowship application preparation. Due to COVID-19 all consultations are currently via phone or video chat. [Book a consultation here](https://springboardforthearts.org/professional-growth/career-consultations/).


### Ryan Evans on a Consult

>>>"The consultation with you was helpful beyond these ways, too - in the energy and drive you injected into the process by hearing where we were at and helping us think about to move forward." - Ryan Evans, [Recreation Arts](https://www.recreationarts.com)
