img_alt: a silhouette of a woman cut into a slightly shiny paper, with an overlay of a found book page that suggests clothing. Some words on the page are circled&#58; straighten, before, wash, blow dry, subdue, and not a safe place. Red straight lines criss-cross the page. The silhouette is on a red background.
